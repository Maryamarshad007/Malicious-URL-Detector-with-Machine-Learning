Malicious URL Detector with Machine Learning

This is a Python project that uses a machine learning model to predict if a URL is safe or malicious. It was made for learning how cybersecurity and AI can work together.

## What It Does

1 Takes a list of URLs and extracts useful features from them
2 Uses a trained machine learning model to classify URLs as "malicious" or "benign"
3 Can be used to test new URLs one by one

# How It Works

1 The model is trained using a dataset of labeled URLs
2 Features like URL length, presence of suspicious words, number of dots or digits, etc., are extracted
3 A Random Forest Classifier is used for prediction

# How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Install required libraries:
pip install pandas scikit-learn
3. Run the training file (if included) to train the model:
python train_model.py
4. Then run the main file to predict a new URL:
python detect_url.py
5. Enter a URL when asked (example: `http://bit.ly/123abc`)
# Example Output
Enter URL: http://bit.ly/123abc
This URL is potentially malicious!
makefile
Or:
Enter URL: https://www.google.com
 This URL looks safe.

# Notes

1 This project is for learning purposes only.
2 The accuracy of the model depends on the dataset and training.
